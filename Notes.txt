Domino's Pizza Builder Bugs
Bug #1:
Choose large HandTossed
Add ShreddedProvolone
Switch to Brooklyn
Click Add to order

The pizza still has provolone even though it's not allowed on brooklyn pizzas.

Bug #2:
Choose large HandTossed
Change special instructions
Click Add to order

The special instructions are ignored on the pizza.

Bug #3
Type Optima card number starting with 374622
Reads it as AMEX card
The regex is wrong in https://cache.dominos.com/olo/6_118_2/assets/build/js/site/base-site.js
It is /^3746-22/ instead of /^374622/
