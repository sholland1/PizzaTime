# It's Pizza Time! üçï

This application allows ordering Domino's pizzas from the command line. You can manage orders, payments, pizzas, and personal info. You can track your
order. The application uses OpenAI to design a pizza using natural language.

## Example usage

### Get an API key from OpenAI
You will need to set up an account with [OpenAI](https://openai.com/). Once you've created the key, it will be located here: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. Copy it into your clipboard for the next step.

### Set the environment variable

#### Windows
Use the following command to set the environment variable. Set the key in the Environment Variables settings dialog to make it permanent.
```cmd
> set OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key>
```

#### Linux
Use the following command to set the environment variable. Put this in your .bashrc or another initialization script to make it permanent.
```bash
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY='<your-key>'
```
