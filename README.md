# It's Pizza Time! üçï

This application allows ordering Domino's pizzas from the command line. You can manage orders, payments, pizzas, and personal info. You can track your
order. The application uses OpenAI to design a pizza using natural language.

This application should work on any platform but has only been tested on Linux.

Warning: Domino's now requires solving a CAPTCHA to place an order. I haven't had time to implement a solution for this.

## Example usage

### Get an API key from OpenAI or Anthropic
You will need to set up an account an obtain an api key from [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) or [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/).

### Set the environment variable

#### Linux
Use the following command to set the environment variable. Put this in your .bashrc or another initialization script to make it permanent.
```sh
$ export OPENAI_API_KEY='<your-key>'
$ export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='<your-key>'
```

#### Windows
Use the following command to set the environment variable. Set the key in the Environment Variables settings dialog to make it permanent.
```bat
